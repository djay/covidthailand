- Contact tracing normally counts as a "Walk-in"
- Proactive tests are normally done at specific high risk locations or places of known cases, rather than random sampling (but it's possible random sampling may also be included).

## Cases by Risk Group

![Cases by Risk](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/cases_causes_3.png)

- Grouped from original data which has over 70 risk categories. Clusters have
  been [grouped into either Work (Factories), Entertainment (bars/gambling etc) or Community (markets) related](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/risk_groups.csv).
- Note: SS Cluster is classified as "Work", but some other market clusters are classified as "Community". This is because there isn't enough data to separate out SS cluster cases
  between those from factories and those from the market. This could change later.
- Risk is most likely determined as part of the PUI criteria process?

# Testing <a name="testing">

## Positive Rate

![Positive Rate](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/positivity_3.png)

- [WHO considers enough testing is happening if positive rate is under %5](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html) rather than tests per population but only if 0.1% of the population is being tested per week (avg 7k tests per day for Thailand). Note this recommendation works best if everyone who might have COVID-19 is equally likely to get tested and there are reasons why this might not be the case in Thailand.
- It's likely there is [missing test data](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki#more-cases-than-positive-results). Using confirmed cases migth be more accurate.
- Confirmed cases excludes ATK Positives (unless they also had a positive PCR test). This is similar to most countries however some like Malaysia, India and [UK count antigen tests in both tests and confirmed cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#testing-capacity)
- This positive rate is based on [DMSC: Thailand Laboratory testing data](downloads#dl-testing). In the [Daily MOPH Situation Reports](downloads#dl-situation-reports) is a number labelled ```Total number of laboratory tests```.  [```Total number of laboratory tests``` is mislabelled and is exactly the same as the PUI number](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki).
- see also [Positive Rate: Full year](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/positivity_all.png), [Tests per Case Graph](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_per_case_3.png) (Positive rate inverted) could be easier to understand.

![Private and Public Tests](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_3.png)

![Private and Public Positive Results](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/cases_3.png)

- [There are more confirmed cases than positives in Thailand's testing data](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki#more-cases-than-positive-results), this could be for various
  reasons but could make the positive rate lower.

Notes

- [2019 had an unusual increase in deaths compared to the previous 4 years](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/deaths_excess_years_all.png) but is unclear yet why. Links excluding 2019 have additionally been included as
  it's not yet clear which range of years provides the best baseline to compare against.

## How to contribute

- As the different sources of the data has increased so has the code needed fetch, extract and
  display this data. All the code is fairly simple python however. It is a fun way to learn scraping
  data and/or pandas and matplotlib.
- Find a [github issue](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/issues) and have a go. Many are marked as suitable for beginners
  - making new plots
  - improve existing plots
  - adding tests so it's faster to make future fixes
  - improving scrapers that miss past data, e.g. vaccination reports
  - [Spotting breaking updates](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/actions) and submitting a pull request to revise the scraper
  - If unsure if you are on the right track, submit a draft pull request and request a review
- Spotted a problem or got an idea how to improve? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/issues) and then have a go making it happen.
- Got Questions? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/discussions) or comment on an issue

### Install

- To install (requires python >=3.9)

  ```sh
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Adding tests

- To run the tests (will only get files needed for tests)

  ```sh
  bin/pytest
  ```

- To add a test
  - Only add test data for dates where the format changed and so the scraper had to get updated. See commit history for dates where this happened or use code coverage.
  - Logs from a full scrape can be used to also identify files/dates that are not scraped correctly
    - if you are trying to add in past regression tests you can also use [```git blame covid_data.py```](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/blame/45ab729d5cdba862de2c5940264f790a5504907a/covid_data.py) on the scraping function to see the dates that lines were added or changed. in some cases comments indicated important dates where code had to change.
  - Add empty file in tests/*scraper_type*/*dl_name*.json
    - for some tests can be use date of file instead or filename.date.json (the date is ignored but helps for readability)
  - Run tests. This will download just the document needed for that test, scrape it and compare the results against the json.
    - of course this will fail but you can look at the generated data and compare it to the original file or other sources to make sure it looks right
  - If the results are correct there is commented out code in the test function to export the data to the test json file.
    - if you are using vscode to run pytests you need to refresh the tests list at this point for some reason
  - Note that not all scrapers have a test framework setup yet. But follow the existing code to add one or ask for help.

### Running just plots (or latest files)

- To get latest files; change into the root directory of your clone of the repository and then:

  ```sh
  wget https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/inputs.tar.gz && \
  tar xzf inputs.tar.gz && \
  rm inputs.tar.gz
  ```

- To build the CSV files needed for plotting from the inputs downloaded above, from the root directory of the repo, run:

  ```sh
  USE_CACHE_DATA=True python covid_data.py
  ```

- To do just plots

  ```sh
  USE_CACHE_DATA=True MAX_DAYS=0 bin/python covid_plot.py
  ```

- When debugging, to scrape just one part first, rearrange the lines in covid_data.py/scrape_and_combine so that the scraping function you want to debug gets called before the others do

### Running full code (warning will take a long time)

You can just use the test framework without a full download if you want to work on scraping.

- to download only the files that interest you first, you can comment out or rearrange the lines in covid_data.scrape_and_combine
- to work on plots you can download the csv files from the website into the api directory and set env MAX_DAYS=0

- To run the full scrape (warning this will take a long time as it downloads all the documents into a local cache)

  ```sh
  bin/python covid_plot.py
  ```

### Building Site

```
$ sudo gem update bundler
$ bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# About

Made with python/pandas/matplotlib. Dylan Jay gave a talk on how easy it is to extract data from PDFs
and powerpoints and plot data at [Bangkok's Monthly ThaiPy Event](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/ThaiPy-Bangkok-Python-Meetup) [Video: "How I scraped Thailand's covid data" (1h mark)](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=2890282134582879)

Why do this? Originally to answer the question ["Was Thailand doing enough testing?"](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki) for myself and because ![Someone was wrong on the internet](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png).
