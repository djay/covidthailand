# Testing <a name="testing">

## Positive Rate

![Positive Rate](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/positivity_3.png)

![Positive Rate by Region - Thailand](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/positivity_region_3.png)

- [Positive rate < 5% for 2 weeks amd > 0.1%/w tested (10k/d tested)) means sufficient tests: WHO](https://www.jhsph.edu/covid-19/articles/covid-19-testing-understanding-the-percent-positive.html)
Assumes easy access to tests for everyone.
- It's likely there is [missing test data](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki#more-cases-than-positive-results). Using confirmed cases migth be more accurate.
- This positive rate is based on [DMSC: Thailand Laboratory testing data](downloads#dl-testing). In the [Daily MOPH Situation Reports](downloads#dl-situation-reports) is a number labelled ```Total number of laboratory tests```.  [```Total number of laboratory tests``` is mislabelled and is exactly the same as the PUI number](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki).
- see also [Positive Rate: Full year](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/positivity_all.png), [Tests per Case Graph](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_per_case_3.png) (Positive rate inverted) could be easier to understand,

## PCR Tests in Thailand by day

![Private and Public Tests](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_3.png)

![Private and Public Positive Results](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/cases_3.png)

- Confirmed cases excludes ATK Positives (unless they also had a positive PCR test). This is similar to most countries however some like Malaysia, India and [UK count antigen tests in both tests and confirmed cases](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/about-data#testing-capacity)

- [There are more confirmed cases than positives in Thailand's testing data](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki#more-cases-than-positive-results), this could be for various
  reasons but could make the positive rate lower.

## How to contribute

- As the different sources of the data has increased so has the code needed fetch, extract and
  display this data. All the code is fairly simple python however. It is a fun way to learn scraping
  data and/or pandas and matplotlib.
- Find a [github issue](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/issues) and have a go. Many are marked as suitable for beginners
  - making new plots
  - improve existing plots
  - adding tests so it's faster to make future fixes
  - improving scrapers that miss past data, e.g. vaccination reports
  - [Spotting breaking updates](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/actions) and submitting a pull request to revise the scraper
  - If unsure if you are on the right track, submit a draft pull request and request a review
- Spotted a problem or got an idea how to improve? [Submit an issue](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/issues) and then have a go making it happen.
- Got Questions? [Start a discussion](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/discussions) or comment on an issue

### Install

- If you are using anaconda you will need to also run this
  ```sh
  conda install -c conda-forge python-crfsuite
  ```

- To install (requires python >=3.9)

  ```sh
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running just plots (or latest files)

The plots are produced from csv files made in covid_data.py.

1. Get the [latest datasets](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/datasets.tar.gz) release to speed up the process.

  - Manually: extract [latest datasets](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/datasets.tar.gz)
 into the top level of the project. It will put csv files into ```api``` and ```inputs/json``` folders.

  - CLI: linux(or WSL); change into the root directory of your clone of the repository and then:
    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/datasets.tar.gz && \
    tar xzf datasets.tar.gz && \
    rm datasets.tar.gz
    ```
2. You can run only the plot function using the USE_CACHE_DATA=True MAX_DAYS=0 env vars

  - CLI (linux)
  ```sh
  USE_CACHE_DATA=True MAX_DAYS=0 bin/python covid_plot.py
  ```
  - IDE: setup a run profile in your IDE similar to this
  ```
          {
            "name": "covidthailand - plot",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "covid_plot.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "env": {
                "USE_CACHE_DATA":"True",
                "MAX_DAYS":"0",
            }
        }
  ```

3. You can comment out parts of covid_plot.py to skip some plots.
   - In USE_CACHE_DATA  only ```*_3.png``` files are produced. 3 is for 3rd wave (since April 2021).

- When debugging, to scrape just one part first, rearrange the lines in covid_data.py/scrape_and_combine so that the scraping function you want to debug gets called before the others do

### Running full code

1. Extract the  [latest input files (~1.3G)](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/inputs.tar.gz).
   This get the latest cache of documents to speed up scraping.

  - Manually: extract [latest input files (~1.3G)](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/inputs.tar.gz)
 into the top level of the project. It will put documents/json etc ```inputs/*``` folders.

  - CLI: linux(or WSL); change into the root directory of your clone of the repository and then:
  ```sh
  wget https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/inputs.tar.gz && \
  tar xzf inputs.tar.gz && \
  rm inputs.tar.gz
  ```
  - Manually

2. To build the CSV files needed for plotting from the inputs downloaded above, from the root directory of the repo, run:

  ```sh
  USE_CACHE_DATA=True python covid_data.py
  ```

3. If many days have passed since the last run then return to step 1. or slightly slow but smaller download is to
   download the [latest datasets](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/releases/download/1/datasets.tar.gz) files
   which will speed up dashboard scrapping which is the slowest part.

4. If you really need to ensure all the files are scraped again then

- To run the full scrape (warning this will take a long time as it downloads all the documents into a local cache)

  ```sh
  bin/python covid_plot.py
  ```

### Running Tests (scraping)

- To run the tests (will only get files needed for tests)

  ```sh
  bin/pytest
  ```

- To add a test
  - Only add test data for dates where the format changed and so the scraper had to get updated. See commit history for dates where this happened or use code coverage.
  - Logs from a full scrape can be used to also identify files/dates that are not scraped correctly
    - if you are trying to add in past regression tests you can also use [```git blame covid_data.py```](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/blame/45ab729d5cdba862de2c5940264f790a5504907a/covid_data.py) on the scraping function to see the dates that lines were added or changed. in some cases comments indicated important dates where code had to change.
  - Add empty file in tests/*scraper_type*/*dl_name*.json
    - for some tests can be use date of file instead or filename.date.json (the date is ignored but helps for readability)
  - Run tests. This will download just the document needed for that test, scrape it and compare the results against the json.
    - of course this will fail but you can look at the generated data and compare it to the original file or other sources to make sure it looks right
  - If the results are correct there is commented out code in the test function to export the data to the test json file.
    - if you are using vscode to run pytests you need to refresh the tests list at this point for some reason
  - Note that not all scrapers have a test framework setup yet. But follow the existing code to add one or ask for help.

# About

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" style="float: right" align="right" />
Made with python/pandas/matplotlib. Dylan Jay gave a talk on how easy it is to extract data from PDFs
and powerpoints and plot data at [Bangkok's Monthly ThaiPy Event](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/ThaiPy-Bangkok-Python-Meetup) [Video: "How I scraped Thailand's covid data" (1h mark)](https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=2890282134582879)

Why do this? Originally to answer the question ["Was Thailand doing enough testing?"](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki) for myself and because too many people were wrong on the internets.
