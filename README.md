## Cases Types and PUI counts
- Source: [MOPH daily situation report PDFs](https://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/situation.php) (inc also [english translated situation reports](https://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/eng/situation.php))
- API: [Download JSON](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/situation_reports) [Download CSV](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/situation_reports.csv)
  - Date:
  - Cases: Total cases that day. Cases Imported + Cases Local Transmission
  - Cases In Quarantine: "Cases found in quarantine facilities/centers"
  - Cases Imported: Cases In Quarantine + Cases outside quarantine
  - Cases Proavtive: Local transmissions that aren't walkins
  - Cases Local Transmission: "Cases infected in Thailand". Cases Walkins + Cases Proactive
  - Tested: says "Total number of laboratory tests" but is mislabeled. ~PUI + 30%
  - Tested PUI: People Classified as Person Under Infestigation. Qualifies for free test.
  - Tested Quarantine: "Returnees in quarantine facilities/centers". Stopped getting updated
  - Tested Proactive: Tested from "active case finding". Stopped getting updated
  - Tested Not PUI: "People who did not meet the PUI criteria". Stopped getting updated
- Notes:
  - The only useful Tested number is "Tested PUI".
  - All the daily numbers have cumulative raw data columns (ending in "Cum") from which the daily numbers are calculated
     - except for all the Cases numbers from 2020-11-02 where daily numbers are taken from the reports
     - to calculate daily numbers missing data is interpolated
  - There are some figures in these reports not included
    - Screened Ports: Screened at "Ports of entry"
    - Screened Immigration: "People renewing their passports at the Immigration
Bureau, Chaeng Watthana"
    - Breakdown of PUI source - Almost all at hospitals
        - Could extract public vs private PUI
    - Data found in other places e.g.
        - Deaths
        - Recovered
        - Hospitized

# Change log
- 2021-04-05 - add tweets with province/type break down to get more up to date stats

# TODO
- get timely data source for cases by type and cases by area
