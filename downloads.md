## Testing Data <a name="dl-testing">

- Source:
   - [DMSC: Thailand Laboratory testing data - latest report](https://www3.dmsc.moph.go.th/) (updated weekly but sporadic)
   - [DMSC: Thailand Laboratory testing data - weekly summary reports](http://nextcloud.dmsc.moph.go.th/index.php/s/wbioWZAQfManokc)
   - also available via [data.go.th testing data](https://data.go.th/dataset/covid-19-testing-data)
   - [Other info on lab network](https://service.dmsc.moph.go.th/labscovid19/indexen.php)
   - This datasource is incomplete as not all tests go via this [DMSc’co-lab database](https://www3.dmsc.moph.go.th/post-view/974). In particular times with large amounts of proactive testing
     sometimes result in more cases reported than positive results.

   - Pos Private: Positive result from private labs
   - Pos XLS: Tests positive results (includes corrected date-less data)
   - Tests XLS: Tests conducted (includes corrected date-less data)
- Notes:
  - Uses case history graphs from the latest PPTX
  - data seems to exclude some non-PCR tests (likely used in some proactive testing)
  - The Test XLS data includes a number of tests and results for which the date is unknown. This has been redistributed into the Pos XLS and Tests XLS numbers. Other than this it
  should be the same numbers as ```Pos``` and ```Tests```.

### Tests by Health District
#### [tests_by_area.json](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_by_area) [tests_by_area.csv](https://github.com/djay/covidthailand/wiki/tests_by_area.csv)

   - Tests Area {1-13} - Total tests (PCR)
- Notes:
  - not all periods are a week
  - data seems to exclude non-PCR tests (likely used in some proactive testing)
  - There are missing files, so some weeks' data are not shown
  - The example graphs shown have been extrapolated using daily totals from the test daily data
